# Leaflet Challenge

#### The USGS provides earthquake data in a number of different formats that is updated every 5 minutes. Using the USGS GeoJSON Feed page we can pick a data set to visualize; the last hour, the past day, the past 7 days and the past 30 days. For this assignment I chose the past 7 days.
